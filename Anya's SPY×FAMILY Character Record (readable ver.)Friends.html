                    <p>Becki, my best friend! We love to go shopping together. In fact, i buy nothing and i think enjoy the process of trying on new clothes is enough. She is so rich...Although I know nothing about her romantic stories about love and love, we always have a good time together. Her score is always higher than me...</p>
                    <p>Second-son, he always drives me mad!!! He likes to call me a fool! But for my father's sake, for the sake of plan B, and for the sake of world peace, i have to learn to get along with him...</p>
