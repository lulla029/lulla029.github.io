                    <p>Look at the figure on the left! He is my papa! He is a super competent spy! I love spy! I chose him as my papa and tried my best to impressed him (using my superpower to complete the crossword puzzle within seconds)in the orphanage. Although he is very strict and somtimes really scary, i still love him a lot! His dream about fighting against violence to build a world without children's tears is very cool! </p>
